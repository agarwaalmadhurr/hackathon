UNLEASHING CUSTOMER SENTIMENTS

## PROBLEM STATEMENT ##
Develop a solution to analyze unstructured customer feedback from various channels (e.g., emails, social media, surveys) to extract key insights, sentiment, and recurring issues. 
The goal is to transform this feedback into structured data that can inform service improvements and product offerings.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ##
Extract sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from customer comments.
Identify common themes or issues mentioned in the feedback (TBC)
Generate actionable insights for improving services.

## STEPS ##

STEP1: DEFINE DATA SOURCES (Channels): 
Social media comments (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)
Survey responses
Call Transcripts
FOR THIS HACKATHON THE SCOPE IS TWITTER

STEP2: DATA INGESTION
Unstructured Data: 
This could include customer reviews, survey responses, call transcripts, social media comments, or chat logs, usually in the form of text.
Use APIs for social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API) to fetch feedback.
Use tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for gathering data from websites.
Storage: Amazon S3: Store your raw unstructured data (e.g., text files, PDFs, audio files) in S3 buckets.
Amazon Kinesis: For real-time streaming data like live feedback from social media or customer service chatbots.

STEP3: DATA PREPROCESSING AND CLEANISNG
Convert all feedback into a consistent text format:
Remove Noise: duplicates, special characters, whitespace
Normalize text: lowercase
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or phrases and removal of stop words, if necessary.
This can be handled using AWS Lambda for simple event-driven data preprocessing tasks (e.g., removing noise, converting formats).

STEP4: DATA STORAGE INTO STRUCTURED (PARQUET) FORMAT FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
Parquet is a structured data format. It is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, especially with large datasets.

STEP5: ANALYSIS ON DATA (using BEDROCK)
(a) Sentiment Analysis
Use Bedrock's pre-built large language models (LLMs) to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
This will classify each piece of feedback as positive, negative, or neutral and give it a sentiment score.
(b) Entity Recognition (NER)
Leverage Bedrock’s ability to recognize entities in feedback, such as product names, service mentions, and customer-specific keywords (e.g., "credit card," "loan," "customer support").
(c) Summarization
Use text summarization models in Bedrock to create concise summaries for long feedback responses. This is helpful for reducing large feedback into more manageable insights.
(d) Topic Modeling
Bedrock’s models can also extract common topics or themes from the feedback, giving you structured categories like "customer service," "loan processing time," or "mobile banking issues."

STEP6: STRUCTURE THE OUTPUT:
Once the Bedrock model returns insights (sentiment, entities, summaries, topics), organize this data into a structured format such as a CSV or JSON file.
Each row/entry can contain:
Feedback_ID (unique identifier)
Sentiment Score (positive, neutral, negative)
Entities Identified (e.g., "loan", "customer service")
Summary (shortened version of feedback)
Topic (e.g., "mobile app," "customer service")

STEP7: STORE AND QUERY STRUCTURED DATA:
Storage Options:
Store the structured data in Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL) or Amazon RDS (Relational database) for efficient querying and reporting.
Querying and Insights:
Use Amazon Athena to query the structured data directly from S3 if you choose to store the results in CSV or JSON format.
This can be used to perform analytics and generate reports on customer feedback trends.

STEP8: Visualization and Reporting:
Use Amazon QuickSight to create visualizations like:
Sentiment trends over time (positive vs. negative feedback).
Most common topics or issues reported by customers.
Entity-based insights (e.g., which products or services are most frequently mentioned).
This can help generate actionable insights for improving customer service or product offerings.

Example Workflow:
Store Feedback: Upload customer feedback data to Amazon S3.
Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data using AWS Lambda.
Analysis with Bedrock:
Run sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic modeling using Bedrock models.
Summarize long-form feedback into concise points.
Structured Output: Export the results (e.g., sentiment, topics, summaries) to a structured format (CSV, JSON).
Store & Query: Store structured data in Amazon DynamoDB or query it directly from S3 using Athena.
Visualization: Use Amazon QuickSight to build visual reports showing key insights.
This workflow is streamlined and allows you to quickly extract valuable insights from unstructured feedback with minimal setup and customization, leveraging the power of pre-built Bedrock models.
