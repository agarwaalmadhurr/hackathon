CUSTOMER FEEDBACK ANALYSIS

## PROBLEM STATEMENT ##
Develop a solution to analyze unstructured customer feedback from various channels (e.g., emails, social media, surveys) to extract key insights, sentiment, and recurring issues. 
The goal is to transform this feedback into structured data that can inform service improvements and product offerings.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ##
Extract sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from customer feedback.
Identify common themes or issues mentioned in the feedback.
Generate actionable insights for improving services.

## STEPS ##

STEP1a: DEFINE DATA SOURCES (Channels): 
Social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)
Customer support emails.
Surveys and feedback forms.
Online reviews.

STEP1b: DEFINE SCOPE (DATA SOURCES) FOR HACKATHON:
TBC

STEP2: DATA COLLECTION
APIs: Use APIs for social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API) to fetch feedback.
Web Scraping: Use tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for gathering data from websites.
Email Parsing: Use libraries like imaplib to extract data from emails.

STEP3: DATA CLEANSING
Remove Noise: duplicates, special characters, whitespace
Normalize text: lowercase
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or phrases and removal of stop words, if necessary.

STEP4: DATA STORAGE INTO STRUCTURED (PARQUET) FORMAT FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS
Parquet is a structured data format. It is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval, especially with large datasets.

STEP5: ANALYSIS ON DATA
(a) Sentiment Analysis:
Pre-trained Models: Use libraries like VADER (for social media sentiment) or TextBlob for general sentiment analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Consider using NLP libraries like spaCy or Transformers for more advanced analysis.
(b) Theme Extraction analysis:
Use techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify common themes.
Libraries like Gensim or sklearn can help with this.

## FUTURE SCOPE ##
F1. VISUALIZING AND REPORTING (CAN BE INCLUDED IN HACK IF TIME PERMITS!)
Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize insights (e.g., sentiment distribution, common themes).
Dashboards: Consider creating an interactive dashboard using tools like Dash or Tableau.

F2. FINE TUNING
F3. ADD OTHER DATA SOURCES
F4. DEFINE MORE INSIGHTS
